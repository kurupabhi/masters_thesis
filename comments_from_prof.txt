Here are my comments:
1.    Template of MPMD used and well formatted in general
2.    Introduction and motivation too short
3.    Concrete research questions missing
4.    Number of citations is not good
5.    It would be good to provide even more details to prove your
expertise.
6.    Additional value for the reader is limited
7.    This draft does not prove your expertise in the field of MPMD
studies. You can do better.
I strongly recommend to focus more on the data science perspective! As
for now I cannot see the how you are meeting the topic “Product
Categorization for Customer Recommendation”
-    Headlines are not self-explaining. Please do not use just one or two
words
-    Research questions not stated
-    language not always appropriate in terms of scientific background
-    You are just using internet resources
-    It’s basically a starting point

- You need please to consider as to write a book and not a short paper or presentation. Please go into the details and proof your expertise.
